# Carl
Welcome there my avid viewers. It would appear as though this project of mine has tickled your fancy, so without furter ado, let's get into it!

## About
Carl is supposed to be designed as a voice assitant for a "vehicle". I put Vehicle in quotes, since as for now, there's nothing vehicle specific about it.

## Goals
1. Keep it nice and simple, understand simple conversational commands, such as reminders, simple queries, and the like.
2. Add a speedometer wired up to LED lights, that change the color of the lights based on speed.
3. Connect to the internet and make use of various API's
4. Yea... as I think of more stuff, I'll add it here

Ideally, I'd like to be able to control certain features on the vehicle using the Pi, but I'm currently not that knowledgable in hardware, so my more outlandish ideas will have to wait for a bit.

## Hardware
This program is being designed to run on a Raspberry Pi 3, accompanied with USB Microphone and Speakers.
